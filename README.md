# gat (graphql api interactive tool)
Develop a Web tool (framework) using natural language constructs to interact to a [GraphQL API](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql). The tool will (re)use knowledge model(s) to learn the proper concepts exposed by the API's schema (e.g., resources, their inputs and outputs) to facilitate a proper text/voice-based interaction. Test and demonstrate the system's features by choosing minimum two [public GraphQL APIs](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis). Inspiration: [Photon](https://naturalsql.com) (article: [A Robust Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.15280)). Bonus: provide multi-lingual support.
