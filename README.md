# gat (graphql api interactive tool)
Develop a Web tool (framework) using natural language constructs to interact to a GraphQL API. The tool will (re)use knowledge model(s) to learn the proper concepts exposed by the API's schema (e.g., resources, their inputs and outputs) to facilitate a proper text/voice-based interaction. Test and demonstrate the system's features by choosing minimum two public GraphQL APIs. Inspiration: Photon (article: A Robust Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL System). Bonus: provide multi-lingual support.
